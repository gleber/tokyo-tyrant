.SH NAME
tcrdb \- the remote database API

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Remote database is a set of interfaces to use an abstract database of Tokyo Cabinet, mediated by a server of Tokyo Tyrant.
.PP
.PP
To use the remote database API, include `\fBtcrdb.h\fR' and related standard header files.  Usually, write the following description near the front of a source file.

Objects whose type is pointer to `\fBTCRDB\fR' are used to handle remote databases.  a remote database object is created with the function `\fBtcrdbnew\fR' and is deleted with the function `\fBtcrdbdel\fR'.  To avoid memory leak, it is important to delete every object when it is no longer in use.
.PP
Before operations to store or retrieve records, it is necessary to connect the remote database object to the server.  The function `\fBtcrdbopen\fR' is used to open a database connection and the function `\fBtcrdbclose\fR' is used to close the connection.

`\fIname\fR' specifies the name of the function.  All databases support "put", "out", "get", "putlist", "outlist", and "getlist".  "put" is to store a record.

It receives a key, and returns a list of the values.  "putlist" is to store records.  It receives keys and values one after the other, and returns an empty list.  "outlist" is to remove records.
